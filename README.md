# frame-stitcher   
uuhhh stitches frames of a recording of a manga into an image or some shit i dont fuckin know  
 
# how 2 use:  
1. download video from youtube  
2. put videos in videos_dir
3. install dependencies(actually u should probably do this first): python-OpenCV and dhash(for frame redundancy checks)  
4. launch main.py  
5. wait a bit  
6. profit

## notes:  
probably breaks if manga in the video scrolled upwards, dunno
